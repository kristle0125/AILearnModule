              <img src="img/Userprofile.png" width="600" height="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">
              <p class="completion-text"><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> refers to the ability of a machine to learn patterns and make predictions. AI does not replace human decisions; instead, AI adds value to human judgment. 
                In its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field that combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving.</p>
              <p class="completion-text">You might be surprised by the way AI is described today. (Spoiler! It doesn’t involve thinking, deciding, or taking over the world.) Read on to discover what AI really does. When you have that in mind, 
                you’ll be ready to dive into the things AI can accomplish—and what it can help humans accomplish.</p>

            <div class="LessonBanner" id="LessonBanner">
              <h1>What is the difference between AI and augmented intelligence?</h1>          
          </div>
          
          <div class="course-overview-text">
            <p class="completion-text">When learning about artificial intelligence, you’ll come across the term augmented intelligence. Both terms share the same objective, but have different approaches. 
              <strong>Augmented Intelligence</strong> has a modest goal of helping humans with tasks that are not practical to do. For example, “reading” 1000 pages in an hour. 
              In contrast, <strong> Artificial Intelligence </strong> has a lofty goal of mimicking human thinking and processes. However, it’s important to note that AI today is not mature enough to perform independent tasks such as diagnosing cancer.</p>
            <h2> ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VS. AUGMENTED INTELLIGENCE</h2>
              <p class="completion-text">Suppose that I got to work today.</p>
              <p class="completion-text">I submit to you that my drive from my home to my office used 3 forms of intelligence. The first
                intelligence was human intelligence. The intelligence there was the intelligence that I needed to operate
                the vehicle, to turn the steering wheel, to check my mirrors. </p>
              <p class="completion-text">The second form of intelligence was artificial intelligence. Once I got on the highway, I turned on the
                self-driving feature in my car. Fancy. Now the car stayed in its own lane, kept an appropriate distance
                from the vehicle in front, and maintained a proper speed. No input from me at all.  </p>
              <p class="completion-text">When I got off of the highway, I used a third form of intelligence: augmented intelligence. Augmented
                intelligence, well, that took the form of all the driver-assist features in the vehicle, things like collision
                detection, to alert me if I got too close to the car in front, and blind spot avoidance to tell me if there was
                a vehicle alongside me as I changed lanes.   </p>
              <p class="completion-text">Artificial intelligence? Well, that is the ability for machines to perform tasks that normally require human
                intelligence, such as reasoning, natural communication and problem solving. It basically replaces the
                need for a human. So, computers doing the work as humans not really needed. And the artificial
                intelligence performs certain tasks and makes decisions, and it's incorporated into so many systems
                today. </p>
              <p class="completion-text">Now contrast that with augmented intelligence. Now this is where you have machines. And you have
                humans both working together. And they're doing so to enhance each other's efforts when completing
                tasks. </p>
              <p class="completion-text">Augmented intelligence systems augment human abilities, things like screen readers for the blind,
                voice-driven navigation, or my in-car collision avoidance system. They're all examples of augmented
                intelligence at work. They act on our behalf in the physical world, but in a way that complements our
                own capabilities. </p>
              <p class="completion-text">So, artificial or augmented? Which form of intelligence will give us the best results for a given problem?
                Well, to answer that, let's create a strength matrix. So, machines vs. humans. </p>
              <p class="completion-text">Now, one thing machines are great at is ingesting large amounts of data. They can take in more data at a
                faster rate than any human could, and they also don't get tired so they can just keep going and going,
                ingesting that data as they go. Machines are especially good at things like repetitive tasks. And to do so
                in a way that is reliably accurate. Unlike my spelling of "repetitive". So, if you need to quickly analyze a
                lot of data or do something over and over again with no margin for error and then specifically artificial
                intelligence is really your best bet. </p>
              <p class="completion-text">Now, on the other hand, us humans, well, we have a few advantages, too. We're very good at
                generalizing information. We can take a single piece of data and understand the concept that it
                represents. </p>
              <p class="completion-text">We're also very good at creativity. We can come up with ideas, we can solve problems, and
                communicate our findings in a way that, well, machines just can't.</p>
              <p class="completion-text">And we have emotional intelligence, too. And that's a big benefit where we can understand the reactions
                of others, and it's critical for tasks like customer service or caregiving. </p>
              <p class="completion-text">Now augmented intelligence is really a sweet spot that combines all of these human strengths with a bit
                of a helping hand from our machine counterparts. By using AI to help us see and understand the world in
                new ways, we are able to do things that would be impossible for us humans on our own.</p>
              <p class="completion-text">So, which form of intelligence is best?</p>
              <p class="completion-text">The answer is both. And that's why I love augmented intelligence. It's how humans will continue to
                thrive and lead in the world and get me to work safely. </p>
              <hr>
              <p class="completion-text">So, what continues to drive the development of AI? </p>
              <p class="completion-text">As computing power and algorithms become more powerful and data volumes increase, companies will adopt new use cases for AI technologies. Companies will embed smart systems 
                into their applications to drive innovation and efficiencies, enhance employee experience, automate tasks, decrease costs, and improve revenue.</p>
              <p class="completion-text">Next, we’ll explore what AI does and the different predictions that AI can make.</p>

          <div class="LessonBanner" id="LessonBanner">
            <h1>What does AI do?</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="course-overview-text">
            <p class="completion-text">Artificial intelligence machines (researchers call them “AI services”) don’t think. They calculate. They represent some of the newest, most sophisticated calculating machines in human history. Some can perform what’s called machine learning as they acquire new data. Others, using calculations arranged in ways 
              inspired by neurons in the human brain, can even perform deep learning with multiple levels of calculations.</p>
            <p class="completion-text">Imagine you are given the job to sort items in the meat department at a grocery store. You realize that there are dozens of products and very little time to sort them manually. How could you use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning to help with your work?</p>  
            
            <h2> Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p class="completion-text">To separate the chicken, beef, and pork, you could create a programmed rule in the format of if-else statements. This allows the machine to recognize what is on the label and route it to the correct basket. </p>  
            <p class="completion-text">A programmed rule might look something like this:</p>  
            <strong><p>if beef_is_on_label: </p>
            <p><span>route_items_to_center_basket()</span></p>
            <p>else:</p>
            <p class="completion-text"><span>redirect_item_to_main_basket()</span></p></strong>
            <p class="completion-text">Artificial intelligence makes this process more efficient.</p> 

            <h2> Machine Learning</h2>
            <p class="completion-text">To improve the performance of the machine, you expose it to more data to ensure that the machine is trained on numerous characteristics of each type of meat, such as size, shape, and color. The more data you provide for the algorithm, the better the model gets.
              By providing more data and adjusting parameters, the machine minimizes errors by repetitive guess work.</p>  
            <p class="completion-text">ML uses feature extranction to sort meat according to its various characteristics</p> 

            <h2> Deep Learning</h2>
            <p class="completion-text">The grocery store has expanded its selection to include more products such as chicken tenders, ground beef, and wild boar. 
              In addition, the products now come in different sizes, shapes, and seasonings. What makes deep learning different?</p>  
            <p class="completion-text">Deep learning models eliminate the need for feature extractions. For your work in the meat department, you decide to use algorithms based on deep learning to sort meat by removing the need to define what each product looks like. Feature extraction is built into the process without human input. Once you have provided the deep learning model with dozens of meat pictures, it processes the images through different layers of neural networks. The layers can then learn an implicit representation of the raw data on their own.</p> 
            <hr>
            <p class="completion-text">How do AI services calculate? And, what do they do with those calculations? Let’s break this down into two parts.</p>
            <p class="completion-text"><strong> Analysis</strong>: AI services can take in (or “ingest”) enormous amounts of data. They can apply mathematical calculations in order to analyze data, sorting and organizing it in ways that would have been considered impossible only a few years ago.</p>
            <p class="completion-text"><strong> Prediction</strong>: AI services can use their data analysis to make predictions. They can, in effect, say, “Based on this information, a certain thing will probably happen.”</p>
            <p class="completion-text">This is what AI services do! Based on data <strong>analysis</strong>, they make <strong>predictions</strong>. It might not seem like much, but that analysis and those predictions can have an enormous impact on human life.</p>
            <p class="completion-text">Before you move on, take a moment to compare “analysis” and “prediction” to the guess you made earlier. Are you surprised? If so, you might be wondering how those two seemingly simple actions can be so important.</p>
          </div>




          <div class="LessonBanner" id="LessonBanner">
            <h1>What predictions AI can make?</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="course-overview-text">
            <p class="completion-text">Most people have a love-hate relationship with the autocorrect feature on phones or computers. What’s happening when you enter a misspelled word? And how does the machine know to suggest a better spelling?</p>
            <p class="completion-text">Simply put, the software analyzes what you’ve typed so far and predicts a likely correction. Your phone or computer (or its online service) has more than just a dictionary of correct spellings. It has a huge library of phrases that humans use in certain contexts on many subjects. So, when you enter a word that’s not in its dictionary, it begins analyzing and predicting and suggests the word you need. Predictions aren’t always accurate. But if they’re correct often enough, they’re useful and can save you time.</p>  
            <p class="completion-text">Here are more ways that AI uses data to make predictions.</p>


            <h2>Human Language</h2>
            <p class="completion-text">Online chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze poorly typed or spoken questions, then predict which answers to give on topics ranging from shipping or business hours to merchandise and sizes.</p>

            <h2> Voice Recognition</h2>
            <p class="completion-text">AI helps doctors identify serious diseases based on unusual symptoms and early-warning signs, and it reads speed limit and stop signs as it guides cars through traffic.</p>

            <h2> Fraud Detection</h2>
            <p class="completion-text">AI analyzes patterns created when thousands of bank customers make credit card purchases, then predicts which charges might be the result of identity theft.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="completion-text">Today’s AI has gone beyond creating driving directions, vacuuming floors, or recommending new fashions. Now it really can mimic the capabilities of the human mind. AI can learn from examples and experience, recognize objects, understand and respond to language, and solve problems. Even more exciting are its future possibilities. Read on to see how AI might evolve over the next half-century.</p>
          

          <div class="LessonBanner" id="LessonBanner">
            <h1>How AI is evolving?</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="course-overview-text">
            <p class="completion-text">Computer scientists have identified three levels of AI based on predicted growth in its ability to analyze data and make predictions. They call these levels:</p>
            <p>• Norrow (2010-2015)</p>
            <p>• Broad (today)</p>
            <p class="completion-text">• General (2050 and beyond)</p>

            <h2> Norrow AI</h2>
            <p>• Narrow AI is focused on addressing a single task such as predicting your next purchase or planning your day. </p>
            <p>• Narrow AI is scaling very quickly in the consumer world, in which there are a lot of common tasks and data to train AI systems. For example, you can buy a book with a voice-based device. </p>
            <p class="completion-text">• Narrow AI also enables robust applications, such as using Siri on an iPhone, the Amazon recommendation engine, autonomous vehicles, and more. Narrow AI systems like Siri have conversational capabilities, but only if you stick to the script. </p>
            
            <h2>Broad AI</h2>
            <p>• Broad AI is a midpoint between Narrow and General AI. </p>
            <p>• Rather than being limited to a single task, Broad AI systems are more versatile and can handle a wider range of related tasks. </p>
            <p>• Broad AI is focused on integrating AI within a specific business process where companies need business- and enterprise-specific knowledge and data to train this type of system.</p>
            <p class="completion-text">• Newer Broad AI systems predict global weather, trace pandemics, and help businesses predict future trends.</p>

            <h2>General AI</h2>
            <p>• General AI refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. </p>
            <p class="completion-text">• Currently, AI does not have the ability to think abstractly, strategize, and use previous experiences to come up with new, creative ideas as humans do, such as inventing a new product or responding to people with appropriate emotions. And don't worry, AI is nowhere near this point.</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="completion-text">There might be another level, known as artificial superintelligence (ASI) that could appear near the end of this century. Then machines might become self-aware! Even then, no levels of AI are expected to replace or dominate you. Instead, scientists hope AI will extend humans’ ability to lead richer lives.</p>

                <h1>THE ERA OF TABULATION</h1>          
            </div>
            
            <div class="course-overview-text">
              <h2>People have analyzed data for centuries</h2>
              <P class="completion-text"> For centuries, people have struggled to understand the meaning that’s hidden in large amounts of data. After all, it’s one thing to estimate how many trees grow in a million square miles of forest. It’s something else to classify what species of trees they are, how they cluster at different altitudes, and what could be built with the wood they provide. That information can be difficult to extract from a very large amount of data. Because it's hard to see without help, scientists call this <strong>dark data</strong>. It’s information without a structure: just a huge, unsorted mess of facts.</P>
              <P class="completion-text">To sort out <strong> unstructured data</strong>, humans have created many different calculating machines. Over 2000 years ago, tax collectors for Emperor Qin Shihuang used the abacus—a device with beads on wires—to break down tax receipts and arrange them into categories. From this, they could determine how much the Emperor should spend on building extensions to the Great Wall of China.</P>
              <P class="completion-text">In England during the mid-1800s, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace designed (but never finished) what they called a “difference engine” designed to handle complex calculations using logarithms and trigonometry. Had they built it, the difference engine might have helped the English Navy build tables of ocean tides and depth soundings that could guide English sailors through rough waters.</P>
              <P class="completion-text">By the early 1900s, companies like IBM were using machines to tabulate and analyze the census numbers for entire national populations. They didn’t just count people. They found patterns and structure within the data—useful meaning beyond mere numbers. These machines uncovered ways that different groups within the population moved and settled, earned a living, or experienced health problems—information that helped governments better understand and serve them.</P>
              <P class="completion-text">The word to remember across those twenty centuries is <strong>tabulate</strong>. Think of tabulation as “slicing and dicing” data to give it a structure, so that people can uncover patterns of useful information. You tabulate when you want to get a feel for what all those columns and rows of data in a table really mean. 
                Researchers call these centuries the <strong>Era of Tabulation</strong>, a time when machines helped humans sort data into structures to reveal its secrets.</P>

            <div class="LessonBanner" id="What-is-AI?">
                <h1>THE ERA OF PROGRAMMING</h1>          
            </div>
            
            <div class="course-overview-text">
              <h2>Data analysis changed in the 1940s</h2>
              <P class="completion-text">During the turmoil of World War II, a new approach to dark data emerged: the <strong>Era of Programming</strong>. Scientists began building electronic computers, like the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) at the University of Pennsylvania, that could run more than one kind of instruction (today we call those “programs”) in order to do more than one kind of calculation. ENIAC, for example, not only calculated artillery firing tables for the US Army, it worked in secret to study the feasibility of thermonuclear weapons.</P>
              <P class="completion-text">This was a huge breakthrough. Programmable computers guided astronauts from Earth to the moon and were reprogrammed during Apollo 13’s troubled mission to bring its astronauts safely back to Earth.</P>
              <P class="completion-text">You’ve grown up during the Era of Programming. It even drives the phone you hold in your hand. But the dark data problem has also grown. Modern businesses and technology generate so much data that even the finest programmable supercomputer can't analyze it before the “heat-death” of the universe. Electronic computing is facing a crisis.</P>

              <h2>A brief history of AI</h2>
              <P class="completion-text">The history of artificial intelligence dates back to philosophers thinking about the question,  "What more can be done with the world we live in?" This question lead to discussions and the very beginning of many ideas about the possibilities involving technology. </P>
              <P class="completion-text">Since the advent of electronic computing, there are some important events and milestones in the evolution of artificial intelligence to know about. Here's an overview to get started.</P>

              <h2>The Era of AI began one summer in 1956</h2>
              <P class="completion-text">Early in the summer of 1956, a small group of researchers, led by John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, gathered at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. There, at one of the oldest colleges in the United States, they launched a revolution in scientific research and coined the term “artificial intelligence”.</P>
              <P class="completion-text">The researchers proposed that “every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” They called their vision “artificial intelligence” and they raised millions of dollars to achieve it within 20 years. During the next two decades, they accomplished tremendous things, creating machines that could prove geometry theorems, speak simple English, and even solve word problems with algebra. </P>
              <P class="completion-text">For a short time, AI was one of the most exciting fields in computer science.</P>

              <h2>But then came winter</h2>
              <P class="completion-text">By the early 1970s, it became clear that the problem was larger than researchers imagined. There were fundamental limits that no amount of money and effort could solve. As the issues in the table below became clear, the money dried up for The First Winter of AI.              </P>

                <div class="col">
                  <div class="col"><strong>LIMITED CALCULATING POWER</strong>: Today, it is important for a computer to have enough processing power and memory. Every ad you see for companies like Apple or Dell emphasizes how fast their processors run and how much data they can work with. But in 1976, scientists realized that even the most successful computers of the day, working with natural language, could only manipulate a vocabulary of about 20 words. But a task like matching the performance of the human retina might require millions of instructions per second, at a time when the world’s fastest computer could run only about a hundred. By the early 1970s, it became clear that the problem was larger than researchers imagined. There were fundamental limits that no amount of money and effort could solve.</div>
                  <div class="col"><strong>LIMITED INFORMATION STORAGE</strong>: Even simple, commonsense reasoning requires a lot of information to back it up. But no one in 1970 knew how to build a database large enough to hold even the information known by a 2-year-old child. </div>

              <h2>The weather was rough for half a century</h2>
              <P class="completion-text">It took about a decade for technology and AI theory to catch up, primarily with new forms of AI called “expert systems”. These were limited to specific knowledge that could be manipulated with sets of rules. They worked well enough—for a while—and became popular in the 1980s. Money poured in. Researchers invested in tremendous mainframe machines that cost millions of dollars and occupied entire floors of large university and corporate buildings. It seemed as if AI was booming once again.</P>
              <P class="completion-text">But soon the needs of scientists, businesses, and governments outgrew even these new systems. Again, funding for AI collapsed.</P>
              
              <h2>The weather was rough for half a century</h2>
              <P class="completion-text">In the late 1980s, the boom in AI research cooled, in part, because of the rise of personal computers. Machines from Apple and IBM, sitting on desks in people’s homes, grew more powerful than the huge corporate systems purchased just a few years earlier. Businesses and governments stopped investing in large-scale computing research, and funding dried up.</P>
              <P class="completion-text">Over 300 AI companies shut down or went bankrupt during <strong>The Second Winter of AI.</strong></P>
              
              <h2>Now, the forecast is sunny</h2>
              <P class="completion-text">In the mid-1990s, almost half a century after the Dartmouth research project, the Second Winter of AI began to thaw. Behind the scenes, computer processing finally reached speeds fast enough for machines to solve complex problems.</P>
              <div class="learning-styles">
                <p>• In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue beat the world’s chess champion by processing over 200 million possible moves per second.</p>

              </div>
              <P class="completion-text">Today, AI has proven its ability in fields ranging from cancer research and big data analysis to defense systems and energy production.

            <h1>A LOOK AT THE TYPES OF DATA</h1>          
          </div>
          
          <div class="course-overview-text">
            <p class="completion-text">Data is raw information. Data might be facts, statistics, opinions, or any kind of content that is recorded in some format. This could include voices, photos, names, and even dance moves!</p>
            <p class="completion-text">Data can be organized into the following three types.</p>
            <div class="Lessontable">
              <div class="row">
              <div class="col">
                <div class="col"><strong>Structured data</strong> is typically categorized as quantitative data and is highly organized. Structured data is information that can be organized in rows and columns. Perhaps you've seen structured data in a spreadsheet, like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. Examples of structured data includes names, dates, addresses, credit card numbers, stock information.</div>
                <div class="col"><strong>Unstructured data</strong> is also known as <strong>dark data</strong>, is typically categorized as qualitative data. It cannot be processed and analyzed by conventional data tools and methods. Unstructured data lacks any built-in organization, or structure. Examples of unstructured data include images, texts, customer comments, medical records, and even song lyrics.</div>
                <div class="col"><strong>Semi-structured data</strong> is the “bridge” between structured and unstructured data. It doesn't have a predefined data model. It combines features of both structured data and unstructured data. It's more complex than structured data, yet easier to store than unstructured data. Semi-structured data uses <strong>metadata</strong> to identify specific data characteristics and scale data into records and preset fields. Metadata ultimately enables semi-structured data to be better cataloged, searched, and analyzed than unstructured data. An example of semi-structured data is a video on a social media site. The video by itself is unstructured data, but a video typically has text for the internet to easily categorize that information, such as through a hashtag to identify a location.</div>

              <h3>Two ways to solve dark data problems</h3>
              <p class="completion-text">If AI doesn’t rely on programming instructions to work with unstructured data, how does AI do it? Machine learning can analyze dark data far more quickly than a programmable computer can. To see why, consider the problem of finding a route through big city traffic using a navigation system. It’s a dark data problem because solving it requires working with not only a complicated street map, but also with changing variables like weather, traffic jams, and accidents. Let’s look at how two different systems might try to solve this problem</p>

                    <P>Then they would have to add much more data describing current weather and traffic conditions. This would have to be revised every few minutes for the entire city!</P>
                    <P>Then they might use a programmable computer to search through the data until it finds a route from start to finish. The entire project would require astronomical resources and time, if it could be accomplished at all!</P>

                    <P>It would do this over and over again, then compare successful routes to identify the shortest one. Although the work sounds repetitious, it requires fewer resources and can be completed more quickly.</P>

            <h3>The machine learning process is entirely different</h3>
            <p class="completion-text">The machine learning process has advantages:The machine learning process has advantages:</p>
              <div class="learning-styles">
                <p>• It doesn’t need a database of all the possible routes from one place to another. It just needs to know where places are on the map.</p>
                <p>• It can respond to traffic problems quickly because it doesn’t need to store alternative routes for every possible traffic situation. It notes where slowdowns are and finds a way around them through trial and error</p>
                <p class="completion-text">• It can work very quickly. While trying single turns one at a time, it can work through millions of tiny calculations.</p>
              </div>

              <p class="completion-text">But machine learning has two more advantages that programmable computers lack:</p>
              <div class="learning-styles">
                <p>• <strong>Machine learning can predict.</strong> You know this already. A machine can determine, “Based on traffic right now, this route is likely to be faster than that one.” It knows this because it compared routes as it built them.</p>
                <p class="completion-text">• <strong>Machine learning learns!</strong> It can notice that your car was delayed by a temporary detour and adjust its recommendations to help other drivers.</p>
              </div>

        <div class="LessonBanner" id="">
            <h1>MACHINE LEARNING USES PROBALISTIC CALCULATION</h1>          
        </div>
          
          <div class="course-overview-text">
            <p class="completion-text">There are two other ways to contrast classical and machine learning systems. One is <strong>deterministic</strong> and the other is <strong>probabilistic</strong>.</p>
            <p class="completion-text">Let’s dig in and see what these two words mean.</p>
            <p class="completion-text">For a <strong> deterministic</strong> system, there must be an enormous, predetermined structure of routes—a gigantic database of possibilities from which the machine can make its choice. If a certain route leads to the destination, then the machine flags it as “YES”. If not, it flags it as “NO”. This is basically binary thinking: on or off, yes or no. This is the essence of a computer program. The answer is either true or false, not a confidence value.</p>
            <p class="completion-text">Machine learning is <strong>probabilistic</strong>. It never says “YES” or “NO”. Machine learning is analog (like waves gradually going up and down) rather than binary (like arrows pointing upward and downward). Machine learning constructs every possible route to a destination and compares them in real time, including all the variables such as changing traffic. So, a machine learning system doesn’t say, “This is the fastest route.” It says something like, “I am 84% confident that this route will get you there in the shortest time.” You might have seen this yourself if you’ve traveled in a car with an up-to-date GPS navigation system that offers you two or three choices with estimated times.</p>
            <h3>If machine learning offers only probabilities, who makes the final decision?</h3>
            <p class="completion-text">This can literally be a life-and-death question. Suppose you have a serious disease and your doctor offers you a choice. Do you want your doctor to prescribe your treatment, or do you want the treatment that a machine learning system determines is most likely to succeed?</p>
            
            <h3>Does common sense make sense?</h3>
            <p class="completion-text">It turns out that in fields, ranging from medicine and education to social studies and government, the best decisions are made using a balance of human and machine strengths. But remember, there is another elusive but vital capability that must also be considered: common sense. You might know people with strong common sense and understand its value. You also might have seen or read output from machines that makes no sense. Yet, there’s a contribution to be made from both sides.</p>
            <p class="completion-text">Common sense draws on many complex generalizations mixed with compassion and abstractions. At this time, only humans can use common sense well. The problem is that common sense is often tainted with bias that can distort your judgment. AI systems can balance this. As long as AI systems are provided and trained with unbiased data, they can make recommendations that are free of bias. A partnership between humans and machines can lead to sensible decisions. </p>

          </div>
        
          <div class="course-overview-text">
            <p class="completion-text">Machine learning solves problems in three ways:</p>
            <p>• Supervised learning </p>
            <p>• Unsupervised learning </p>
            <p class="completion-text">• Reinforcement learning</p>
            <p class="completion-text">Let's explore each one!</p>
            <p class="completion-text"><strong>Supervised learning</strong> is about providing AI with enough examples to make accurate predictions. </p>
            <p class="completion-text">All supervised learning algorithms need <strong> labeled data</strong>. Labeled data is data that is grouped into samples that are tagged with one or more labels. In other words, applying supervised learning requires you to tell your model:</p>
            <div class="learning-styles">
              <p>1. What the key characteristics of a thing are, also called <strong>features</strong>.</p>
              <p class="completion-text">2. What the thing actually is.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="completion-text">For example, the information might be drawings and photos of animals, some of which are dogs and are labeled “dog”. The machine will learn by identifying a pattern for “dog”. When the machine sees a new dog photo and is asked, “What is this?”, it will respond, “dog”, with high accuracy. This is known as a <strong> classification problem</strong>.</p>
            <p class="completion-text"></p>
            <p class="completion-text"></p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="LessonBanner" id="">
            <h1>UNSUPERVISED LEARNING</h1>          
          </div>
        
          <div class="course-overview-text">
            <p class="commpletion-text">In <strong> unsupervised learning</strong>, a person feeds a machine a large amount of information, asks a question, and then the machine is left to figure out how to answer the question by itself.</p>
            <p class="commpletion-text">For example, the machine might be fed many photos and articles about dogs. It will classify and cluster information about all of them. When shown a new photo of a dog, the machine can identify the photo as a dog, with reasonable accuracy.</p>
            <h2>Unsupervised learning occurs when the algorithm is not given a specific “wrong” or “right” outcome. Instead, the algorithm is given unlabeled data. </h2>
            <p class="commpletion-text">Unsupervised learning is helpful when you don't know how to classify data. For example, imagine you work for a banking institution and you have a large set of customer financial data. You don't know what type of groups or categories to organize the data. Here, an unsupervised learning algorithm could find natural groupings of similar customers in a database, and then you could describe and label them. </p>
            <p class="commpletion-text">This type of learning has the ability to discover similarities and differences in information, which makes it an ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="LessonBanner" id="">
            <h1> REINFORCEMENT LEARNING</h1>          
          </div>
        
          <div class="course-overview-text">
            <p class="commpletion-text"> <strong>Reinforcement learning</strong> is a machine learning model similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes is reinforced to develop the best recommendation for a given problem. The foundation of reinforcement learning is rewarding the “right” behavior and punishing the “wrong” behavior.</p>
            <p class="commpletion-text">You might be wondering, what does it mean to "reward" a machine? Good question! Rewarding a machine means that you give your agent positive reinforcement for performing the "right" thing and negative reinforcement for performing the "wrong" things. </p>
            <p class="commpletion-text">As a machine learns through trial and error, it tries a prediction, then compares it with data in its corpus.             </p>
            <div class="learning-styles">
              <p>• Each time the comparison is positive, the machine receives positive numerical feedback, or a <strong>reward</strong>.</p>
              <p class="completion-text">• Each time the comparison is negative, the machine receives negative numerical feedback, or a <strong>penalty</strong>.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="commpletion-text">Over time, a machine’s predictions will grow to be more accurate. It accomplishes this <strong>automatically</strong> based on feedback, rather than through human intervention.</p>
